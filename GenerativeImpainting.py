# --- Example Usage (Requires you to create two local files: original.jpg and mask.png) ---

# 1. Create 'original.jpg' (your photo).
# 2. Create 'mask.png' which is a black and white image:
#    - Areas you want the AI to generate new content *in* should be **WHITE**.
#    - Areas you want to *keep* unchanged should be **BLACK**.

# Example (Uncomment to run after setting up your files):
# run_inpainting(
#     original_image_path="original.jpg",
#     mask_image_path="mask.png",
#     prompt="A vibrant orange sunset over a tropical beach, highly detailed",
#     output_filename="generative_enhance.png"
